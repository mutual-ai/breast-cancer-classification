Different classification algorithms/programs for the Wisconsin breast cancer data set (UCI - Machine Learning)

Notes:
* Logistic regression is popular when there are two classes.
* Linear Discrimnant Analysis (LDA) is useful when the number of observations is small, the classes are well-separated, 
given the Gaussian assuption (normal distribution). Also good for classes >2 . 
When the true decision boundaries are approximately linear, the logistic regression
and LDA portray similar results. 
* Quadratic Discrimnant Analysis (QDA) gives better results when 
the boundaries are non-linear.
* Naive Bayes (not done here) is useful when there are a lot of predictors (X's).
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric approach that is good for more complicated decision boundaries.
